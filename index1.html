    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        HTML gives structure to web pages and tells the browser how to display content. 
        It uses tags to define headings, paragraphs, images, and links. 
        Proper structure improves accessibility and SEO. 
        Clean markup also makes teamwork and maintenance easier.
